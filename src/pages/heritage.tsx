          Made for centuries, if not for millennia, in different areas of
          Friuli, the `&quot;scarpet`&quot;, the characteristic fabric shoes
          made by women for the whole family, tell a long history of culture and
          tradition and perfectly interpret the philosophy of recovery and
          reuse.

          <p>
            Although the first written testimonies of the creation of the
            Friulian `&quot;scarpets`&quot; date back to the nineteenth century,
            the tradition linked to their production is, in all likelihood, much
            older, and has its roots in a time when every scrap of fabric and
            every material, even the poorest, was precious, with a view to
            recovery and re-use interpreted in the strictest and most literal
            sense of the terms. Women were the architects of the
            `&quot;miracle`&quot;, those who were able to make shoes for the
            whole family with a few scraps of cloth and string. Every season was
            good to wear these shoes that were produced in different variations
            so as to keep the foot warm in winter, and preserve it from the hot
            summer temperatures. They were the shoes for the party, worn by
            brides on their wedding day, but they were also and above all those
            that were made using only the fabrics available and overlapping
            pieces of cloth to create more resistant soles according to an
            ancient tradition probably millenary handed down generation in
            generation. Each area boasted its own variant that differed from the
            others by an embroidery or a particular seam, rather than by a
            decoration or a different shape.

          <h3 className="pb-0 font-bold">Characteristics</h3>
          <p>
            The `&quot;scarpet`&quot;, sometimes also called
            `&quot;friulane`&quot; are presented as light shoes similar to
            slippers made of canvas, velvet or other fabrics available according
            to the season in which they are to be worn. They are all hand-sewn
            and embellished with embroidery and decorations generally with a
            floral theme. The distinctive element of these shoes is the sole
            made up of overlapping fabric scraps that are hand-tufted with
            string to reinforce them. Although the techniques of production and
            the shape of the footwear have remained almost unchanged over the
            centuries, the decorations, embroideries and patterns have, however,
            remained in step with the times and today, therefore, it is more and
            more frequent to find models that meet their tastes while
            maintaining the classic and traditional appearance that
            distinguishes them.

          <p>
            The ancient Friulian footwear, over time, have found a certain
            diffusion even in neighbouring areas such as the Belluno Dolomites
            and the Treviso pre-alps, going as far as Venice where, in the
            eighteenth century, it was not rare to see them even at the feet of
            the gondoliers. However, Friuli Venezia Giulia remains the home of
            these delightful cloth shoes.
